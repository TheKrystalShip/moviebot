# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `web/activity`: the player, as a plain page. video.js and hls.js, audio and subtitle menus
  built from the manifest and split into feature and commentary, per-viewer preferences in
  `localStorage`, and a scrub bar drawn at the film's true duration with the transcoded region
  shaded — the player library only knows what the playlist advertises, which is wrong for a
  title still being written.
- Shared play, pause and seek over the hub, with revision gating, position derived from the
  anchor against a server-clock offset, echo suppression by comparison, and graduated drift
  correction that nudges the rate for a small gap and seeks only for a large one.
- A browser verification suite: it plays the film, reads the menus, drives two viewers through
  play, pause and seek from either side, knocks one out of step to watch it recover, and edits
  the fixture manifest to a transcoding state to exercise the seek clamp.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `MasterPlaylist`: ingest writes an HLS master playlist binding the audio renditions to the
  video, and the manifest points at it. Without one a player handed a bare video rendition plays
  the film silently with no audio track to switch to.

### Fixed

- `docs/api-contract.md` described echo suppression as a flag cleared when the expected media
  event arrives. A seek interrupted by a second seek raises no `seeked` at all, so such a flag
  stays set and swallows the next thing the viewer does. The rule is now to compare against the
  position that was applied.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `MovieBot.Api`: the library, media and session surface. Serves manifests and HLS with the
  content types hls.js requires, holds shared session state, and pushes it over SignalR.
- Server-authoritative sessions with monotonic revisions and a server-clock timestamp on every
  push, so reordered or duplicated pushes and skewed client clocks are all harmless.
- Head-aware seek clamping. A seek past what has been transcoded is granted short of the head
  and answered with `SeekClamped` to the caller alone.
- `no-store` on playlists for a title still transcoding; segments served immutable.
- `MovieBot.Tests`: two real SignalR clients against the app in-process, covering propagation,
  revision ordering, clamping, participant broadcast and position derivation.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `MovieBot.Core`: the manifest contract — title, duration, transcode status and head, video
  rendition, audio tracks and subtitle tracks — with a source-generated camelCase serializer and
  an atomic writer, so a reader polling during a transcode never sees a half-written document.
- `MovieBot.Ingest`: the ingest CLI. Probes a source with ffprobe, extracts every text subtitle
  track to WebVTT and the container's cover art, then transcodes to HLS with `h264_nvenc`,
  writing `EVENT` playlists so the film is playable within seconds of the transcode starting.
- NVDEC decoding via `-hwaccel cuda`. Software-decoding a 16 Mbps HEVC Main 10 source costs
  35 s of CPU per 40 s of film against 5.5 s on the GPU, and saturates every core for the
  length of a feature while the GPU sits half idle.
- HDR detection from the source transfer function, with `tonemap_opencl` converting PQ and HLG
  sources to BT.709 and SDR sources left untouched. `--tonemap` overrides the detection.
- Subtitle classification into text and bitmap codecs. Bitmap tracks are listed as unavailable
  with a reason rather than dropped.
- Track labelling from the container's title tags, with commentary split out by ffmpeg's
  `comment` disposition.
- `--dry-run`, which prints the manifest a source would produce without transcoding it.
