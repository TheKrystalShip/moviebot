# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `POST /api/auth/discord/callback`: the Activity's sign-in exchange. The client secret redeems
  the code here because a secret shipped to a browser is not a secret; the player handles only
  the code and the token that comes back, which is its own.
- `GET /api/config`: serves the application id, which is public, so the player needs no
  build-time configuration and no rebuild when it changes.
- `discordEnvironment.ts`: the player as an Activity. Two things differ from the browser page and
  they are the two the environment seam exists to hold — the room is the SDK's instance and the
  viewer is who Discord says they are. The API, media and hub are the same relative paths, since
  a root mapping forwards them.
- `ActivityLaunchPresenter`: the bot opens the film in the voice channel. When it cannot — no
  application id, a channel it cannot see, a missing Create Instant Invite — it says which and
  falls back to the browser link rather than failing quietly.

### Changed

- Playback starts at half volume. A film mastered for a cinema is punishing at full on laptop
  speakers. It is a starting point, not a shared setting: anyone who has set their own keeps it.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- The API serves the player from `wwwroot`, so one origin carries the page, the API, the media
  and the hub — a Discord Activity then needs one URL mapping rather than several.
- `scripts/build-player.sh` builds the player and installs it there.
- `deploy/`: systemd units for the API and the bot, and the nginx vhost. Secrets come from a
  mode-600 `EnvironmentFile`, because systemd does not read `/etc/environment` and that file is
  world-readable.
- A name gate: the plain link carries no identity, so the player asks once and remembers.

### Fixed

- A launch link naming a film the room is already showing no longer reloads it. Loading a title
  resets the position, so a friend clicking the link mid-film sent everyone back to the start.
- The invite URL the bot logs omitted `CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE`. Installing from it produced a bot
  that could not create Activity invites, failing later as though Discord were at fault.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `MovieBot.Bot`: a Discord.Net bot with a slash command that resolves a film, opens the room's
  session and replies with a launch link and a poster embed. It holds no state: the session is
  named by the voice channel, so two people asking in the same channel reach the same room with
  nothing remembering that the first one asked.
- `ILaunchPresenter`, the seam between resolving a film and handing someone into the player. The
  link presenter is what exists; an Activity presenter replaces it without the command changing.
- A guild allow-list, because a verified application cannot stop being addable.
- The poster is attached only when an address Discord's own servers can reach is configured. An
  unreachable image renders as a broken embed, which reads as a broken bot.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `web/activity`: the player, as a plain page. video.js and hls.js, audio and subtitle menus
  built from the manifest and split into feature and commentary, per-viewer preferences in
  `localStorage`, and a scrub bar drawn at the film's true duration with the transcoded region
  shaded — the player library only knows what the playlist advertises, which is wrong for a
  title still being written.
- Shared play, pause and seek over the hub, with revision gating, position derived from the
  anchor against a server-clock offset, echo suppression by comparison, and graduated drift
  correction that nudges the rate for a small gap and seeks only for a large one.
- A browser verification suite: it plays the film, reads the menus, drives two viewers through
  play, pause and seek from either side, knocks one out of step to watch it recover, and edits
  the fixture manifest to a transcoding state to exercise the seek clamp.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `MasterPlaylist`: ingest writes an HLS master playlist binding the audio renditions to the
  video, and the manifest points at it. Without one a player handed a bare video rendition plays
  the film silently with no audio track to switch to.

### Fixed

- `docs/api-contract.md` described echo suppression as a flag cleared when the expected media
  event arrives. A seek interrupted by a second seek raises no `seeked` at all, so such a flag
  stays set and swallows the next thing the viewer does. The rule is now to compare against the
  position that was applied.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `MovieBot.Api`: the library, media and session surface. Serves manifests and HLS with the
  content types hls.js requires, holds shared session state, and pushes it over SignalR.
- Server-authoritative sessions with monotonic revisions and a server-clock timestamp on every
  push, so reordered or duplicated pushes and skewed client clocks are all harmless.
- Head-aware seek clamping. A seek past what has been transcoded is granted short of the head
  and answered with `SeekClamped` to the caller alone.
- `no-store` on playlists for a title still transcoding; segments served immutable.
- `MovieBot.Tests`: two real SignalR clients against the app in-process, covering propagation,
  revision ordering, clamping, participant broadcast and position derivation.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `MovieBot.Core`: the manifest contract — title, duration, transcode status and head, video
  rendition, audio tracks and subtitle tracks — with a source-generated camelCase serializer and
  an atomic writer, so a reader polling during a transcode never sees a half-written document.
- `MovieBot.Ingest`: the ingest CLI. Probes a source with ffprobe, extracts every text subtitle
  track to WebVTT and the container's cover art, then transcodes to HLS with `h264_nvenc`,
  writing `EVENT` playlists so the film is playable within seconds of the transcode starting.
- NVDEC decoding via `-hwaccel cuda`. Software-decoding a 16 Mbps HEVC Main 10 source costs
  35 s of CPU per 40 s of film against 5.5 s on the GPU, and saturates every core for the
  length of a feature while the GPU sits half idle.
- HDR detection from the source transfer function, with `tonemap_opencl` converting PQ and HLG
  sources to BT.709 and SDR sources left untouched. `--tonemap` overrides the detection.
- Subtitle classification into text and bitmap codecs. Bitmap tracks are listed as unavailable
  with a reason rather than dropped.
- Track labelling from the container's title tags, with commentary split out by ffmpeg's
  `comment` disposition.
- `--dry-run`, which prints the manifest a source would produce without transcoding it.
